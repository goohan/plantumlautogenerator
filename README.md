# PlantUML auto generate image diagram

This extension automatically generates an image from the source code of a PlantUML diagram. The generation is performed by saving a file with one of the extensions associated with PlantUML: `.wsd, .pu, .puml, .plantuml, .iuml`.

The extension also provides a command available in the command palette (`F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`). Be sure to choose the appropriate file type in the source explorer.

## Features

### Generar imagen de diagrama

![demo](/assets/screenshot-generate-diagram.gif)

Generates an image from a PlantUML file. Generated image has the same name as the source file, but with a `.png` extension and is placed in the same folder as the PlantUML file. The image is generated by saving the file, but can also be generated using the command palette, in which case you must make sure to select the appropriate element (plantUML file) in the source explorer. If the file already exists, it's replaced.
